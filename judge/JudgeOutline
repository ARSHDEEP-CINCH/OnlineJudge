Step by Step outline of how the judge will work:

1. A submission is recieved from the fronted. A submission consists of the 
   following:

- Problem ID/Problem
- Contest ID (if going on)
- User or Team ID(User if practice problem, Team if contest)
- Language of Code
- Solution as a text file

* - Validate all data on client side


2. Hit server where it validates all judge data is present and sane (userID + 
   contestID can't exist together). Then it forwards data to the judge instance (seperate process?).
   Decrements team submission. Updates team score when judge responds.


* - Judge is broken into two parts first part is the job creater second is the worker. Judge is 
	responsible for only testing code and nothing else. All data passed to judge can be assumed 
	be valid (so we can throw errors)

3. Part 1 of Judge, job creator, recieves new submission. It gets all the data it needs to 
   run the submission and turns it into a job and stores it in coffee-resque.


4. Part 2 of Judge, worker, takes submission and tests it using docker and what not (establishes a score). Sends response to server to communicate back to frontend.
